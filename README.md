We want to understand you better, so do not be afraid of failing, this is not a right or wrong matter. Just do your best. Good luck! :smile:

## Goal

:snowman: Your team is developing an application for users to create and explore tourist spots on a map. Your task is to create a Web application to consume and register this information.


## Non-functional specs

* You may use plain **Javascript**, but we encourage you to use **TypeScript** if you feel comfortable to.
* You may choose to use a framework, but if you are feeling really :godmode:badass, do without it.
* You may use a css pre-processor, *webpack*, *babel* and *others*.
* You may use any piece of technology you think is necessary or cool.
* It must be builded in *components*.
* Serviceless, you need to use the browser's technologies to consume and save data. Use what you prefer. _Pure language_, libs, tools, you decide.
* It must be easy to setup and deploy. :children_crossing:
* Use **Nunito** and **Montserrat** Fonts.
* Do your best.


## User Stories

#### :lock: As a anonymous user
* I want to sign up using my **Facebook** account.
* I want to sign in using my **Facebook** account.
#### :unlock: As a logged in User
* I want to see a list of tourist spots in a 5 km radius from a given location.
* I want to search for tourist spots by name.
* I want to register a tourist spot (picture, name, geographical location and category).
* I want to comment about a tourist spot.
* I want to see comments about a tourist spot.
* I want to add pictures to a tourist spot.

* I want to see my favorites tourist spots.
* I want to remove a tourist spot from my favorites.
* I want to upvote a tourist spot.
* I want to see the tourist spots I registered.
* I want to create new categories.


### Business Rules

* Anonymous users can only see things.
* Application start with a pre populated data. Places, images, comments and users.



## Deliverables

* The source code in a public git repository.
* A public live demo.
* Instructions how to run the development environment.
* Instructions how to deploy.


## Evaluation

The evaluation will follow the criteria below.

* :dart: Good practices.
* :wrench: Code maintainability.
* :rocket: Performance.
* :watch: Full operation.
* :factory: Robustness.
* :earth_americas: Scalability.

*Decision making and your reasons behind your choices...*

## Bonus Deliverable

Beyond your hard skills we are also interested on how you think, the way your code evolves and grows until it's done. So if you are feeling like a [awesome developer streamer](https://github.com/bnb/awesome-developer-streams) :blush: :tv:, we would like to see a video of your development process. It would allow us to better understand you and give you a more complete feedback.
